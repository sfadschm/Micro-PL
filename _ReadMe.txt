LabVIEW Interface for µ-PL Setup

Micro-PL
  1 Usage
    This is the main interface for the µ-PL setup.
    It integrates control of the cryostat, monochromator, CCD and objective drive.
    The Mapping Tool and Raman Tool Set 2.0 are embedded to facilitate automated mapping.
    For usage and editing of the scripts, SynerJY 3.8 must be installed in advance to provide the necessary dlls.

Drive Calibration
  1 Usage
    Can be used to calibrate the U/X characterisitcs of a Newport ESC-A Controller.
    Records microscopy images in pre-defined voltage sweep steps (of e.g., REM chessy)

Stability
  1 Verwendung
    Can be used to estimate the spatial stability of a microscope system.
    Records microscopy images in pre-defined time intervals (of e.g., REM chessy).
